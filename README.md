# Main Pipeline : 
#### First , Exploratory Data analysis by ploting the ecdf , compraing distributions , etc..
#### Secondly , calculating the optimal parameters and their confidence intervals.
#### then putting questions and answering them Using Hypothesis tests.

# Hypothesis Tests Done : 
### Permutation test
### Bootstrap test 
### Kolmogrov smirnov test
